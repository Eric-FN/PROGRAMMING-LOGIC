# JavaScript Basics - Operators, Conditionals, Loops, and Functions

This project demonstrates the use of basic JavaScript features, including comparison operators, logical operators, conditional statements, loops, functions, and error handling. It serves as a beginner-friendly guide to understanding core JavaScript concepts.

## Features:
- **Comparison Operators**: Examples include greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), equality (`==`), strict equality (`===`), and more.
- **Logical Operators**: Covers AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`).
- **Conditional Statements**: Demonstrates `if`, `else`, `else if`, and ternary operators for decision-making.
- **Loops**: Includes `for`, `while`, `do while`, `for...in`, and `for...of` loops.
- **Functions**: Shows various ways to define and use functions, including arrow functions.
- **Error Handling**: Uses `try`, `catch`, and `throw` to manage errors in code.

## Examples:
1. **Comparison Operators**:
    - `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`

2. **Logical Operators**:
    - `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)

3. **Conditional Statements**:
    - Example using `if...else`, `else if` to check the time of day and output a greeting.

4. **Ternary Operator**:
    - Simplified decision-making in a single line: `condition ? 'true' : 'false'`.

5. **Date Object**:
    - Work with `Date` object to manipulate and format dates.

6. **Switch/Case**:
    - Example for handling multiple conditions based on a single variable.

7. **Destructuring Assignment**:
    - Demonstrates extracting values from arrays and objects into variables.

8. **Loops**:
    - `for`, `while`, `do while`, and `for...in` loops for iteration through arrays and objects.

9. **Error Handling**:
    - Using `try`, `catch`, and `throw` to handle errors and prevent crashes.

## Usage:
Clone the repository and explore the examples in the `index.js` file. Each section contains clear examples of how to use JavaScript operators, conditionals, loops, and functions.
